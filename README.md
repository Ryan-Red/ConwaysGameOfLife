# ConwaysGameOfLife
Java Implementation of Conways' Game of Life I made a few years ago as a final project.

This code is all in French. 

I thought this might be interesting to uplad for anyone interested in making their own version of the game and wanted some inspiration.

## Differences with the original Conway's Game of Life
My version features customizable rules, i.e. you can change the rules of how many adjacent cells result in a cell dying of over population, the amount required for a cell to be revived etc.

This version also has save and load states (I thought it might be interesting to have)

Finally, I added a "preset" tool of famous configurations, to facilitate making complex cool structures
